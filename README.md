Title
AI Trainer – Week 1: NLP Data Preparation & Evaluation
Week 1 practice: NLP data preparation and evaluation mindset for AI Trainer role

Purpose

This repository documents Week 1 hands-on practice toward becoming a professional AI Trainer with a focus on NLP and LLM readiness.

The goal of this week is not model training, but mastering the core responsibility of an AI Trainer:

Preparing, structuring, and evaluating high-quality textual data for language models.

Scope of Week 1

This week focuses on:

Understanding the AI Trainer role in NLP projects

Creating high-quality question–answer pairs

Preparing clean, domain-specific textual data

Evaluating data quality from a model-training perspective

Documenting decisions and evaluation criteria

Out of scope (intentionally):

Model training

Fine-tuning

Heavy coding

Theory-only explanations

Key Skills Practiced

Text quality judgment

Ambiguity detection

Bias awareness

Language clarity and consistency

Human-like answer formulation

Dataset thinking (not prompt-only thinking)

Deliverables (Week 1)

By the end of this week, this repository will contain:

A small but high-quality annotated NLP dataset

Written evaluation notes explaining why data is good or bad

Clear evidence of AI Trainer mindset, not tutorial-following

Evaluation Mindset

All outputs are judged using these criteria:

Is the input unambiguous?

Is the answer reusable across contexts?

Is the language natural and neutral?

Would this help a language model generalize?

Is unnecessary information avoided?
